/* ----------------------

Note: BEFORE tackling each question below,
read the tests in the test file.

1. Add properties called "legs" and "sound".
2. Add a method called "getOlder" so that it increases
   the age by 1 whenever it is called and then 
   returns the new age.
3. Add a new method called speak that returns the
   sound property whenever it is called.

    this.age = 1;
    this.legs = 4;
    this.sound = "tweet";
  }
  getOlder() {
    return (this.age += 1);
